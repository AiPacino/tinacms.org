title: 'Front-end Setup'
---

We're going to be using the Next.js blog starter as the base of our project. By default it pulls all it's data from the filesystem (which is a lovely way of doing things) but we'll want make some changes to have it pull data from Strapi's GraphQL API.

Open a new terminal (make sure you keep Strapi running) and create a new project along side strapi using the following command:

```bash
yarn create next-app -e blog-starter tina-strapi-blog
```

Navigate into the new directory and start up the website's dev server.

```bash
cd tina-strapi-blog
yarn dev
```

If you navigate to `http://localhost:3000` you'll see what we're working with here. Our goal will to be replace the index page and blog post pages with ones that pulls all their data from Strapi.

## Setup Environment Variable

Let's quickly setup an environment variable so that our front-end application knows the location of our Strapi server. In the root of the project create a file called `.env` and put in the Strapi url

```.env
STRAPI_URL=http://localhost:1337
```

Then, also at the root of the project create a new file called `next.config.js` and populate it with

```js
require('dotenv').config()

module.exports = {
  env: {
    STRAPI_URL: process.env.STRAPI_URL,
  },
}
```

Now whenever we start our front-end project we will have access to this `STRAPI_URL`. And we'll easily be able to have different environments point to different Strapi servers.

## Add Tina

Let's start getting some Tina things in place that will let us use our editing experience a bit down the road. First install Tina and the `styled-component` peer dependency.

```bash
yarn add tinacms styled-components
```

### Add the Provider

Go into `pages/_app.js`, we're going to wrap what's currently being returned here with our Tina and Strapi providers.

Delete what the `MyApp` function is currently returning and setup up the CMS object to use Strapi.

```js
import "../styles/index.css";

import {
  StrapiMediaStore,
  TinaStrapiClient,
} from "react-tinacms-strapi-bm-test"; // @TODO
import { TinaCMS } from "tinacms";

export default function MyApp({ Component, pageProps }) {
  const cms = new TinaCMS({
    sidebar: { hidden: true },
    apis: {
      strapi: new TinaStrapiClient(process.env.STRAPI_URL),
    },
    media: {
      store: new StrapiMediaStore(process.env.STRAPI_URL),
    },
  });
  return (
    /* We'll fill this out soon */
  );
}
```

We're instantiating the CMS object, giving it access to a Strapi client and also giving it access to a Strapi media store. This will let us communicate with Strapi's APIS and also will help Tina know how to upload media to the Strapi server.

Now we want to return the page content, wrapped in providers so that every page has access to the CMS and Strapi client.

```js
import {
  StrapiMediaStore,
  StrapiProvider,
  TinaStrapiClient,
} from 'react-tinacms-strapi-bm-test' @TODO
import { TinaCMS, TinaProvider } from 'tinacms'

// ...

return (
  <TinaProvider cms={cms}>
    <StrapiProvider
      editMode={false}
      enterEditMode={() => {}}
      exitEditMode={() => {}}
    >
      <Component {...pageProps} />
    </StrapiProvider>
  </TinaProvider>
)
```

We're fudging some values in for `editMode`, `enterEditMode`, and `exitEditMode` for right now so we can focus on pulling data from Strapi. We'll come back to this when we're ready to get editing working.

After doing this, you should be able to refresh the browser and notice that _nothing_ has changed ðŸŽ‰. Don't worry, we're making progress we now have Tina on our site and are ready to start using it.
